## Cerberus Banking Malware

The full source code for the Cerberus banking malware was been released online after being leaked by one of its developers. Kaspersky experts have been monitoring Cerberus since July 2020, although the Trojan virus was originally tracked in the summer of 2019. Cerberus is an Android banking Trojan which can be rented on hacker forums. It was been created in 2019 and is used to steal sensitive, confidential information. Cerberus can also be used to send commands to users' devices and perform dangerous actions.

In late February 2020, ThreatFabric researchers published a report claiming that Cerberus had been restructured and enhanced with RAT (Remote Access Trojan) abilities and was capable of stealing multi-factor authentication (2FA) tokens from Google Authenticator.

Although at the time Cerberus was still in its test phase, ThreatFabric warned users that the malware could be released “soon”. Their predictions were proven right in late July, when the Cerberus source code went up for auction after the breakup of its development team. Kaspersky researchers found that one of the authors made the decision to publish the project source code on a popular Russian-speaking underground forum

## Implementation
However, cyber criminals are now able to acquire Cerberus for free, resulting in a rapid increase in cyber attacks on mobile banking in Russia as well as other European countries. We’re already seeing an increase in attacks on users since the source code was published. It’s not the first time we’ve seen something like this happen, but this boom of activity since the developers abandoned the project is the biggest developing story we’ve tracked for a while.

Kaspersky has warned Android users to only download and install applications from the Google Play store, as well as deactivate the function in smartphone settings for installing programmes from unknown sources.

Back in February 2021, ThreatFabric reported that Cerberus was able to target communication applications such as Gmail, Outlook, and Telegram, as well as numerous banking applications, including Lloyds Bank Mobile Banking, Wells Fargo Mobile, and Santander.
