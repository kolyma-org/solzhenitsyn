    Fake or rogue antivirus software is a type of malware that pretends to have found an infection on the victim’s computer. 
    In some cases, the cybercriminal’s objective may only be to scare the victim. 
    However, many rogue antivirus programs also try to extract payment 
    – for the removal of malware that hasn’t actually been detected… and may not even exist.
