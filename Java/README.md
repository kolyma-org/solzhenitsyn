Like most Police Ransomware Trojans, the Cheshire Police Authority Ransomware tries to make the victim believe that they are being processed by the police. The Cheshire Police Authority Ransomware preys on inexperienced computer users' guilt by accusing them of viewing illegal pornographic material, allowing their computer to distribute malware and distributing or dealing with copyrighted content without permission. The Cheshire Police Authority Ransomware message lists penalties of thousands of pounds and years of jail time unless the victim pays a fine of 100 pounds. The scam does not stop at a threatening message; the main problem when dealing with malware like the Cheshire Police Authority Ransomware Trojan is that these kinds of threats lock the victim's computer, preventing the victim from accessing Windows or any files stored on the infected computer. Because of this, these kinds of malware attacks are often referred to as Winlockers.
