The full Cerberus source code was leaked on underground forums and is now available to cybercriminals for free. Kaspersky experts have actively tracked the Android banking malware’s revival since July 2020, following the original developer’s abandonment, attempted sale, and eventual release of the project. Through evolving functionality including two-factor (2FA) authentication stealing and remote access tool (RAT) features, the level of Cerberus infections has already increased, especially in Russia and Europe.

    Cerberus is a sophisticated Android banking malware, 
    originally tracked in the summer of 2019, 
    and actively distributed on a MaaS (Malware-as-a-Service) basis across various underground forums. 
    The recent source code leak – referred to as Cerberus v2 – opens up new, 
    public opportunities for cybercriminals looking to threaten the banking sector through Android devices.
